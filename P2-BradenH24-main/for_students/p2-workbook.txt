[X] correct P2 Canvas Assignment submission [none]: 
[X] clear explanations in p2-workbook.txt [none]: 
[X] correct P2G Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] program runs (or seems to run correctly - worth looking at error console) [final-grtown]: 
[X] frame rate seems OK (not too slow) [final-grtown]: 
[X] UI is there and seems to work (can lookat and ride) [final-grtown]: 
[X] highlight list looks OK [final-grtown]: 
[X] visually distinct from example [final-grtown]: 
[X] theme makes sense (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Union South area during the winter time
[X] cool theme bonus (need explanation) [final-grtown]: This project was very fun for me because it reminds me a lot of my freshman year. I 
used to have to trek back to my dorm in Lakeshore from downtown Madison during the winter time (it was particularly cold that year too). It is cool to bring that
feeling to life.
[X] objects created for this assignment 1, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Union South, hand drawn replica
[X] objects created for this assignment 2, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Discovery Building, hand drawn replica
Additional created objects: Cars, Snowy Trees, GrHouse (heavily modified since WB8), GrWideHouse (heavily modified since WB8), New CS Building
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 1, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: GrHouse - brick house with brown shingled roof
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 2, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: GrWideHouse - White brick house with spanish-styled roof
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 3, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Car - Each a unique color, some drive left around the one way streets and some drive right
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 4, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Discover Building
[X] 5 more kinds of objects 5, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Union South
[X] has building, natural, vehicle (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Buildings (USouth, DiscoveryBuilding, and more), Natural (Trees, Snow), Vehicle (Cars, Forklift, Backhoe, etc)
[X] loaded model (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I loaded in a model human. He dances every ~40 seconds (there are other animation options as well, I liked the dance option). 
This person represents me freshman year, although I would definitely have had more layers on!
[X] shader: identifiable and not trivial (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Created shader representing the patio furniture at Union South
[X] three behaviors you made 1, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Moving Excavator arm, each subgroup has a unique motion to look like it is scooping from ground
[X] three behaviors you made 2, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Moving backhoe arm, each subgroup has a unique motion to look like it is scooping from ground; different from Excavator
[X] three behaviors you made 3, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Bird Movement (moves up and down as well as in a circle. Also "flips/spins" occassionally)
Additional movement: 
- forklifts move horizontally and vertically, their "forks" also move up and down. 
- Cars turn left and right
- Snow falls, randomly moves left and right, and returns to top of map when reaching the bottom
[X] at least one object is rideable / followable [final-grtown]: 
[X] behavior that is not simple (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Excavator and Backhoe - hierarchal movement for arms
[X] articulated figure (need explanation) [final-grtown]:
